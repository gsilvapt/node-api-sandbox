# RESTful API built in node.

This to-do management app is part of the Complete Node.Js Developer Course on Udemy.

This works as a sandbox as I have edited a few things throughout the course to test my own stuff and this is where I'm posting most of the code.

## Travis

This project has Travis CI running for pure demonstration purposes.


## Achievements

With this project, I hope to learn how to create a RESTful API using node, while applying TDD principles. 
Also, I'm expecting to use new tools in this stage, including MongoDB, Postman and Robo 3T to work with this API building process.

This project in particular also works for future reference and knowledge sharing as I'm trying to comment the entire code to explain what I am doing.
